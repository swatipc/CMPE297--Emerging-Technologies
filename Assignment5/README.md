**Text classification with attention and transformer layer**

This repository contains implementation of below concepts:
1. Simple transformer with attention layer for text classification of imdb
2. Semantic similarity with pretrained BERT demonstrating the use of SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) Corpus to predict sentence semantic similarity with Transformers.
3. Text classification with pretrained word embeddings (GLOve)
4. Question answering using BERT on SQUAD dataset
5. A colab tool for Data augmentation using GPT2
